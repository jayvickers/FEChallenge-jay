# IBM Frontend Coding Challenge

**Thank you for your interest in IBM. We are excited to learn more about you!** 

This exercise is intended to help us get a better understanding of your approach to design and front-end development. There is no right or wrong way to complete this project, and there are no tricks or sneaky bits to trip you up - we just want to see how you build things. Feel free to use Google, Stack Overflow, or other resources to complete this project. We want to know how you develop normally, not how you work from memory or in extraordinary circumstances.

### Task
Given JSON data returned from a REST API, create one or more React _functional_ (not class) components using hooks and written in TypeScript to present the data in a table format.

### Starter Code
We have provided a skeleton React app with a basic home page for you to start with. The starter code was written in TypeScript and the configuration for Webpack, Babel, TypeScript, and other resources has been taken care of. **:warning:Rename the provided webpack.config.js.txt file to webpack.config.js**, then the app should be ready to run, after an initial `npm install`, using `npm start`. It is set up with the Carbon React framework/design library, which you can find the React documentation for [here](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/getting-started-welcome--welcome). This site provides detailed information about all of the available components in the Carbon library, as well as how to use them, and will be very helpful for this task.

### Guidelines
 - We anticipate this exercise will take about 4-6 hours, over the course of 2-3 days
 - Do NOT exceed 4-6 hours; we don't want to be disrespectful of your time
 - Please don't use jQuery
 - Aside from jQuery, feel free to use any tools you prefer to complete the project, including frameworks, preprocessors, or libraries

### Requirements
 - While plain JavaScript (in .js/.jsx files) is supported in this environment, we recommend you write your code in TypeScript (.ts/.tsx files)
 - Integrate a client-side router (such as `react-router`, which has already been installed) to introduce component routes
 - Create a navigation bar and create links for the existing home page and any new pages you make; connect these links with the component routes
 - Request the JSON data from this API URL: https://patch-advisories-dev.mybluemix.net/api/v1/products?fmt=json
 - Create a new container and supporting components to present the API data in a table view
 - Add actions to the table rows for updating and deleting them (don't worry about making any new API calls for this, just perform the data manipulation in the frontend)
 - Add support for pagination to the table (again, don't worry about making any new API calls, just manipulate in the frontend)
 - Be creative and play with the UI. Again, there's no "right way" to build this

The last detail is the most important... We want you to have fun with it!  We want to see your personality in the code, UI/UX, and the little things you do to make this simple content come to life.

### Submission Requirements
Post your solution to a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Send the repository URL back to the same person who sent you these instructions.

### Questions?
If there's anything that's unclear or if you just have a general question, we're just an email away! :)
